# Person 4

end

def my_hash_deletion_method!(source, thing_to_delete)

return source.keep_if {|element| element != thing_to_delete}

end


# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
# delete_if = deletes elements in the array that satisfy the condition.
# keep_if = keeps elements in the array that satisfy the condition, deleteing those that dont.

# Person 5
def my_array_splitting_method(source)
  source # This line is here to make sure all tests initially fail. Delete it when you begin coding.

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.

# Release 1: Identify and describe the Ruby method you implemented. Teach your
# accountability group how to use the methods.
#
#
#


# Release 3: Reflect!
# What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?
#
# Well, the first thing is that ruby methods are named very well so no confusion is made. Delete_if fr example is very
#easy to interpret. One must always be aware of the arguments it takes and what type of object they expect. Another thing
#I noticed is that for every action you want to execute there are various ways to code it and many methods to do it with
#which maked it very interesting when I see other poeple coding the same challenge in other forms.
