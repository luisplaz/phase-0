Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

To create a repository on Github you must first log in into your github account and on the top right area you will see a "+" sign. When this is clicked the option of making a repository will show. Click this option and fill the following blank areas.
Repository Name (The title explains itself ...)
Description (Basically a brief summary of what the repository will contain"
Public in this case so people can view it
And add in license a MIT license.
That’s it you made a repository.....

Now to clone this repository go to your profile setting in the top right where your avatar is.
Click "YOUR PROFILE", this will take you to your profile main page
Once there you should see a tab with the word "Repositories" on it click that.
Click the name of the newly created repository and this should take you to the repository page.
Finally here on the right menu there should be a title that reads "HTTPS clone URL" click the clipboard button below it.
This will copy the cloning url into the computer clipboard.

Now....we clone.
Open Git Bash and go to the folder you’d like to clone this repository into. Remember commands like (cd , cd ., etc let you move around your pc)
Once there type git clone [HERE WE WRITE THE URL WE COPIED IN OUR CLIPBOARD] and hit enter.
You just cloned your repo....

Describe what open source means.

Open source means that you can customize it and add your own creations and ideas into a project, website, application, software etc....
It lets other contribute in the creation of a better or even totally different software derived from an original set of codes that can be accessed by the public.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think it’s a great it makes it possible to create wonderful things result of the massive contribution of the public. The amount of minds that can be helping build a project are infinite and the result is almost always incredible.

Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licensing is important so you can hold the patent of your work, so that the work you are sharing can still be attributed to you. Also, it specifies what permissions you are willing to grant in regards to the manipulation of your work.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

Pulling and pushing was solidified with this challenge as well as the meaning of the various licenses that I’ve been meaning to look up for a while but had forgotten. The instructions were pretty straight forward so there was no real struggle.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Some that explained licensing a little better were of use. These were the ones I used: http://opensource.org/licenses/category
