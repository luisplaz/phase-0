#1.1 Think About Time Reflection

In this section the most important subject is making good use of your time and molding your environment and habits so that they make you more productive. Strategies like the pomodoro technique or little habits seem incredibly simple for the effect they seem to have in productiveness and time management. Also these new ways of creating and making habits long lasting blew my mind as they contradicted the way i thought was best to go on about creating them.

We also learned about time boxing, which is basically assigning a certain amount of time to work on something without focusing in completing it to its entirety but rather what can be done in the time allotted and then reviewing what you were able to complete.

Like I states before, I currently have bad time management habits but I do tend to practice time boxing to some extent. Each day I have a sort of schedule of things I would like to complete and try to make time during the day for each activity, my downfall id say is trying to do many things at the same time instead of assigning time slots for each one separately.

I would like to employ the pomodoro technique as well as practice concentration and getting in the “zone”. I also plan on trying out the little habits strategy so my schedule can be more organized.

For phase 0 I will manage my time using the pomodoro technique and try to create a tiny habit so I can do the homework little by little each day after going to the gym.

##1.2 The Command Line Reflection

Shell is basically a program that takes in user commands and then access the operating system so these commands can be run. Bash "Bourne again shell" is an enhanced version of this same shell and works the same way. It is one of many shell programs.

I would have to say that the most challenging part of going through this material is that its very dense and it has a lot of information that is sometimes hard to digest. I wrote all the commands and tried various of examples of each one and was able to successfully comprehend them all.

In my opinion the most important commands are those for knowing where you are located and move around your directories, pwd,cd,ls.

pwd - Prints the working directory

ls - Lists files in current directory

mv - Move file

cd - Changes directory

../ - Go up one folder

touch - Create empty file

mkdir - Makes new directory

less - Shows file content fixed to fit the screen

rmdir - Removes directory

rm - Remove a file

help - Shows help files related to a parameter

###1.4 Forking and Cloning

Creating a new repo is quite easy just access your profile in your github account and click on the top right + button. This will give the options of creating a new repository or organization. Click repository and do the next things:

* Repository Name (Choose one you like)

* Set public

*Add License (MIT License)

And your done.....

To fork a repo just access the repo on github and then click the fork button on the top right area of the screen. The icon looks like a doctor's stethoscope, you cant miss it.

Once this button is clicked various profile pictures will show up choose your own so its forked to your repo section.

Now the harder part, to clone a repo just access said repo on github and copy the url on the HTTPS clone URL section on the center right section. It should look something like this https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook.git (Links to an external site.). The open git bash and write the next lines :

git clone https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook.git (Links to an external site.) 

In the above code change the link to the one you obtained from the repository. Youll see git bash work and after its done you have cloned the repo.

Now why did we fork the repo???. Well, this is so we can work on ti without messing with the original files that will later be used by other cohorts. Forking allows us to have access to these files and edit them without affecting the originals, basically we work on copies of originals.

I really had no struggles setting up the repo and forking and cloning on github but in this whole process i did learn how to open files with sublime text 3 through git bash that had been cloned form github.
