 Reflection

What is a one-to-one database?

A one to one database is in essence a whole database divided to rpovide better performance linking to the initial database those elements that are retrieve less. A one to one database links information related and asscoiated uniquely to the initial item.

When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).

I would use a one to one database if I were to store art pieces, since there are so many details involved and one might benefit from dividing those that are looked up less.

What is a many-to-many database?

A many to many database is that where one element can be asscoiated a variety of others but can also be part of a group that is associated to one element.

When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).

Patiens and research can be an example. As a patient can be part of many research programs and a program can have many patients.

What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense? 

Well its kind of a mind puzzle because one has to see how things are linked and if what relathionship makes more sense. So viewing the exact relationship taking place is for me the hardest part.
