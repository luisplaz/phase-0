How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

Well, you can use devtools to review how your website elements would look if you removed certain format or added format without having to change your master code. So you get to play around with the formatting of your elements.

What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

Absolute: Positions element in relation to first non static parent it has.
Fixed: Anchors element relative to browser window. It stays there even if scrolling is done.
Static:Its the default position all elements have once added in browser window.
Relative:Positions element relative to where it is normally located.

What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

It was very interesting to play around with the DOM and finally see with live examples what some of the formatting code did.
