<!-- 
- What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

Well for one the <html> tag is a must so we saw that one first. Then the <head> and <body> tag that any html should at least have, and for this specific challenge we saw the <br> tag a lot as well as the <div> tag for creating needed divisions in the page.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

Elements get laid out on the page through tags that allow structure in an html doc. The browser displays elements in the order of hierarchy, for example then it will go through the <html> tag then the < header> and <body> then inside to the next child inside each of these tags and so on.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

In this challenge we learned about sublimes snippet function. I will probably use this a lot in the future because it makes writing code a lot quicker and simpler if you create a library of common snippets used in a regular basis. I was not able to research any other snippets but intend to during the course of this week.
