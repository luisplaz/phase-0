What does puts do?

Puts is a command that only writes the output of a program, code, algortihm, etc into the screen. It does not evaluate the code.

What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is any number that does not contain decimals, or in another way its a whole number and it does not matter if its negative or positive.

A float is the opposite, its a number with decimals. It can be negative or positive as well.

What is the difference between float and integer division? 

Integer division returns an integer even if the result of the division gives a fraction. In case of a fraction the computer will round up to the nearest integer.

Float division allows the result to be a float as well and the output is not rounded.

How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

The difference between integer division and float division is that they have diferent outputs or in a simper way they produce different results because the computer treats each operation differently. 

For explanation purposes lets think of division of a cake into cake pieces. If you divide the cake in integer division it can only be divided into identical pieces while if we divide using float division we can divide the cake into identical pieces and some pieces that are different (in this case they would be the decimals.)

```ruby

p 365*24

p 10*365*24*60

```

How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

Ruby is pretty straightforward with these operations. With symbols like + - * / , it is basically like normal math. Only thing is that if done with 2 integers and the result has a fraction the division rounds up to the nearest integer with floats it give the result as a float.


What is the difference between integers and floats?

Float contains decimals other doesnt.

What is the difference between integer and float division?

This question is answered in the text above..

What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

Strings are sets of letters they are used to produce messages.

What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

Local variables are like elements that store a value (string, integer etc). They are used to avoid repeating code and making life easier. One uses them when you plan to use a certain value more than once.

How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

Easy challenge because Ive seen code before but it was a good review.
