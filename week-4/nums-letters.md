What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is any number that does not contain decimals, or in another way its a whole number and it does not matter if its negative or positive.

A float is the opposite, its a number with decimals. It can be negative or positive as well.

What is the difference between float and integer division? 

Integer division returns an integer even if the result of the division gives a fraction. In case of a fraction the computer will round up to the nearest integer.

Float division allows the result to be a float as well and the output is not rounded.

How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

The difference between integer division and float division is that they have diferent outputs or in a simper way they produce different results because the computer treats each operation differently. 

For explanation purposes lets think of division of a cake into cake pieces. If you divide the cake in integer division it can only be divided into identical pieces while if we divide using float division we can divide the cake into identical pieces and some pieces that are different (in this case they would be the decimals.)
