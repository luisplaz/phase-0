//USER STORY ---> As a user I would like to have a function called sum.This function should add all the elements in any odd length 
//array and return the value.
//Also, this function should also add all the elements in any even length array and return the value.

//USER STORY ---> As a user I want to have a function called mean.This function mean should add all the elements in any odd lengthed
//array or even lengthed array and divide it by the number of elements in this array and return the value.


//USER STORY ---> As a user I want to have a function called median. The function median should take an array check if it has an odd
// number of elements. If it does divide the array length by 2 and round up the result.
//Then return value that is in the index equal to the result obtained by this division.
//If its false, it should divide the array length by 2 and store the result. Then multiply this result by 2 and add one to the new 
//result, then divide this new result by 2. Return the product of this last division.
