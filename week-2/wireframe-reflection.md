•What is a wireframe?

A wireframe is a blueprint of how you want your project to look visually. How items will be organized, their hierarchy and the way the user will interact with the website.

What are the benefits of wireframing?

Wireframing allows us to get very creative with the way we imagine our project or our client’s project without all the code and difficult design elements. It’s a rough, mainly black and white, way of making sure you have a solid base to build upon that will help avoid errors and provide a smooth and easy navigation for the users.
It also facilitates the coding and design process because it shows a clear picture of what is wanted from the developer and website designers.

Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

Yes I did, the options on the free software are limited but it was a very satisfying new experience.to see my website reaching a new step in its development. 

Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I sketched it first then changed it a little bit and created the virtual version on gomockingbird.

What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

My main question was the experience needed in editing and designing software like Photoshop to create and modify wireframes. The resources in the challenge made this point clear. It’s not essential but it does help.

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

I did not find any part tedious and I enjoyed the design via the web software the most because it helped me create a cleaner version of what I had in mind for my website.
