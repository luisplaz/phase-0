<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
We were able to navigate the challenge with ease but had to look up some tags as a reminder. It was exciting turning the knowledge into something tangible.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
It was hard to understand at first but after we implemented it we understood what they meant and their value to the code readability factor.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
We did great! We used references from previous excercises to maintain good habits and practices.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
The good is that its easy to read and write because the tags are kind of intuitive. The bad is that there no good practice of formatting within HTML. ( At least not that we know at this point)

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Planning out what tags will be needing before writing it so we can keep an organized flow.
