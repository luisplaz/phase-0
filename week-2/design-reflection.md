What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

The 6 phases of Web Design are the following:

1. Info Gathering (Here we gather all the information relative to our purpose, goals, audience, content etc...)
2. Planning (In this stage we plan what we intend to design, here we use the sitemap like the one linked above)
3. Design (Here we start sketching and designing the website, one may use wireframes here)
4. Development (Now the for the real work, the project is now being developed with the information gathered from the previous steps)
5. Testing and Delivery (After the development stage the project is ready for the test procedures so we can check for errors or thing the client might want to change)
6. Maintenance (The post development face that keeps the project running and up to date with any technology based improvement etc..)

What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

The primary goal of my site is to inform the audience about myself, my goals, my aspirations, my background and my capabilities. Also, it’s a way to offer contact information in case one is needed.
The content my site will feature is mainly text and some images.

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience would be anyone interested in knowing who I am so it’s very broad. My site will address their doubts and questions informing them via texts and images.

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

The primary action would be search for information, then vie my portfolio and lastly contact me. 

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

Important things one might want to know about design and user experience are:

1. What works for one site might not work for another and user experience and the effect of designing for one crowd might change depending on many elements so it user satisfaction can’t be predicted.
2. UX (User Experience) can’t be measured with traditional metrics because it’s subjective.
3. UX is not the same as usability (Usability affects user experience though...)

What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

User experience design is in essence designing so that a user (costumer) can have the best experience during the process of being in your website. Another way to put it is making the experience of moving, interacting, viewing your site the most pleasant possible for the general public (I state general public because some people might have a different opinion about the website experience).
Now, this is valuable because it attracts and retains more users and in a money making project this is a good thing.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I really liked this challenge and I cants say any part was tedious. But I’d have to admit that the designing for performance slides were a little complicated to understand and a bit long for our level of understanding in this matter. Everything else was great.
