<!-- 
// What did you learn about the DOM?

// I learned that you can modify the visual aspect of a page with javascript code that is then passed through the dom console to the html
// file. The coding is pretty straightforward and readable.

// What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?

//  Some useful methods we used in this challenge were:
// getElementBy......ClassName/TagName/Id, that indicate what you want to modify or retrieve.
// After these method you then can choose by index which individual tag with this class you want to modify.
// We also used the .style and modified various style properties.
